# Instructions

## Server
1. Start the server in a Docker container by running the following command:
```sh ./run_worker_start_local.sh ```
2. Note that it is running on Port 13000

## Client
1. Use the tool netcat to spin up a client
   ```nc localhost 13000```
* If this doesn't work you can also try
   ```telnet localhost 13000```
2. Create as many clients as you'd like by repeating step 1. You should be able to chat with each other.
